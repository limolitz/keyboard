Amended US keyboard with German letters and symbols as well as some Swedish letters.

Copy `us` file to `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/` and `evdev.xml` to `/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/`. It is recommended to backup the original files before and also enable another keyboard layout, as a non-functional keyboard makes it kinda hard to login.
